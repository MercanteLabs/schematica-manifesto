# Platform providers

Just like all businesses, software houses that develop and maintain ecommerce
platforms need to operate on a business model that is sustainable.

## Long-term challenges

The typical challenges that platform providers face in order to stay relevant
in the long-term are:

- _Minimising time-to-market for new features._

  The ecommerce industry moves blazingly fast, which means that suppliers of
  ecommerce services - i.e. platform providers - need to move fast too.

  The market for ecommerce platforms is also becoming increasingly saturated,
  given the relatively low up-front costs required for a new challenger
  platform to join the scene.

  Failure of platforms to support their customers (i.e. retailers) in keeping
  up with industry trends may mean that retailers look to alternative platforms
  to meet their demands.

- _Adopting an extensible software architecture._

  It is important for businesses to recognise technology as an enabler of
  capabilities, and to regularly review its effectiveness rather than let it
  stagnate and eventually become a liability.

  Opportunities can present themselves in various forms, and so architectures
  that place an emphasis on openness and interoperability (this includes
  integrations with third-party solutions as well as between internal systems)
  are not only quicker to leverage such innovations, but are also more
  resilient and better equipped to respond to both expected and unexpected
  change.

- _Building a sustainable workforce._

  Aside from those rare software organisations that are both strategically and
  operationally supportive of truly polyglot environments, most will settle on
  defining a predominant tech stack. This is usually done for a variety of
  reasons, one of which is that it actually has a big impact on talent
  acquisition.

  Those that have adopted popular languages and frameworks in their tech stack
  will find it easier to recruit for talent, both in terms of there being a
  wider pool of candidates with skills in these technologies to choose from, as
  well as candidates themselves being attracted to the prospect of working with
  popular technologies.

  Of course, popularity can change over time and it's difficult to predict what
  the next best thing will be. The safest way a business can prepare itself for
  shifts in the job market of tomorrow is to start focusing on increasing
  modularity and interchangeability of its tech stack of today.

## Picking battles

All being said, the reality is that we don't live in a world with unlimited
resources. Platform providers need to work on their strengths, and prioritise
effort to where they can add the most value.

For example, this could mean cultivating close partnerships with tenant
retailers across the platform to gain a deeper and richer understanding of the
problem space. Or perhaps it could mean gaining unique insights into consumer
behaviour by crunching data and statistics gathered exclusively from the
platform.

Technology is actually less of a key differentiator. After all, retailers are
more interested in the capabilities of the platform, rather than the minutiae
of what technology choices are being made, or how the platform is being managed
under the hood.

Absorbing the risks of implementation is simply part of an ecommerce platform's
offering. So, when a platform provider finds that the maintenance overhead of
their self-managed technology solution is becoming a problem, or at least is no
longer providing a competitive edge, then the solution has become a liability
and they should consider ways to mitigate its impact, potentially by delegating
the lower value aspects of it - especially if there are better performing
alternatives readily available.
