# Platform providers

Just like all businesses, software houses that develop and maintain ecommerce
platforms need to operate on a business model that is sustainable.

The typical challenges that ecommerce platform providers face in order to stay
relevant in the long-term are:

- _Minimising time-to-market for new features._

  The ecommerce industry moves blazingly fast, which means that suppliers of
  ecommerce services - i.e. platform providers - need to move fast too.

  The market for ecommerce platforms is also becoming increasingly saturated,
  given the relatively low up-front costs required for a new challenger
  platform to join the scene.

  Failure of platforms to support their customers (i.e. retailers) in keeping
  up with industry trends may mean that retailers look to alternative platforms
  to meet their demands.

- _Adopting an extensible technology architecture._

  It is important for businesses to recognise technology as an enabler of
  capabilities, and to regularly review its effectiveness rather than let it
  stagnate and eventually become a liability.

  Opportunities can present themselves in various forms, and so architectures
  that place an emphasis on openness and interoperability (this includes
  integrations with third-party solutions as well as between internal systems)
  will not only provide a competitive edge from earlier incorporation of such
  innovations, but are also more resilient and better equipped to respond to
  both expected and unexpected change.

- _Building a sustainable workforce._

  Aside from those rare organisations that are both strategically and
  operationally supportive of truly polyglot environments, most organisations
  will settle on defining a predominant tech stack. This is usually done for a
  variety of reasons, one of which is that it actually has a big impact on
  talent acquisition.

  Software companies that have adopted popular technologies in their tech stack
  will find it easier to recruit for talent, both in terms of there being a
  wider pool of candidates with skills in these technologies to choose from, as
  well as candidates themselves being attracted to the prospect of working with
  popular technologies.

  Of course, popularity can change over time and it's difficult to predict what
  the next best thing will be. The safest way a business can prepare itself for
  shifts in the job market of tomorrow is to start focusing on increasing
  modularity and interchangeability of its tech stack of today.
