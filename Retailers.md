# The retail landscape

Personal experience of working in the ecommerce consultancy industry has shown
that the retail industry can be roughly divided into three "tiers" of
businesses that benefit from an ecommerce presence:

1. _Small retailers_ (e.g. indie stores, mom-and-pop shops).

   The goal for these businesses to build an online presence is to increase
   exposure.

   As they have limited capacity to focus on scaling up their operations, their
   investment in ecommerce technology is minimal.

2. _Mid-tier retailers_ (e.g. small franchises, market niches).

   These businesses already have an online presence, which is often backed by
   some level of integration with a warehouse / logistics solution. The solution
   is brought in to automate key processes, but often also ends up imposing
   restrictions on other processes - both a blessing and a curse.

   What mid-tier retailers need most from their ecommerce platform is
   **adaptability**. Innovation will often be in areas like minimising
   production costs or reducing time to market, and their chosen platform's
   ability to support such fast-paced incremental changes will be pivotal to
   the business's survival.

   For those with enough bandwidth to look ahead, the next biggest
   consideration will be the platform's **scalability**. The technology must be
   able to support an unprecedented surge in demand, triggered by growth
   initiatives like market diversification and global expansion.

3. _Enterprise retailers_ (e.g. chain stores, online marketplaces).

   These businesses have their own unique selling point and their own unique
   ecommerce technology to match. Retailers of this size already have
   scalability built into their platform.

   Their goals differ from mid-tier retailers in that they prioritise being
   effective over being efficient - inefficiencies are more readily absorbed by
   the rest of the business.

   Enterprise retailers will aim to leverage (or even create!) the latest
   cutting-edge technologies. They have both the resources and the talent pool
   to incubate experimental projects. However, they still require an adaptive
   platform to easily enable these innovations to be put into use.

To summarise, _adaptability_ and _scalability_ are two important traits of an
ecommerce platform that forward-looking retailers will look for in order to
become and remain competitive at scale.
