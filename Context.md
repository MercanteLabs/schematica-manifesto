# Context and rationale
Personal experience of working in the ecommerce consultancy industry has shown
that the retail merchant space can be roughly divided into three "tiers" of
businesses that benefit from an ecommerce presence:

1. _Small businesses_ (e.g. indie stores, mom-and-pop shops).

   The rationale for these businesses to build an online presence is to
   increase exposure. As they have limited capacity to focus on scaling up
   their operations (there are more important things to do right now!), their
   investment in ecommerce technology is minimal.

2. _Mid-tier businesses_ (e.g. small franchises, market niches).

   These businesses already have an online presence, which is often supported
   by some level of warehouse / logistics setup arranged by a third-party
   solutions provider. However, the solution can be both a blessing and a
   curse: it can offer a way to automate some processes, but can also impose
   key restrictions on other processes. In fact, it is not uncommon for
   businesses to cycle through multiple solution providers trying to find
   solution that fits.

   Having **flexibility** is the key to gaining an edge over competitors,
   whether in terms of production costs or time to market. It is crucial for a
   business with limited margin for error to be able to readily adapt. Failure
   to stay relevant could be catastrophic.

   But mid-tier business don't want to just stay where they are. They want to
   expand into new territories, diversify into adjacent markets, reap the
   benefits of economies of scale. A lack of **scalability** in the underlying
   technology infrastructure will hold the business back from reaching its
   longer-term goals.

3. _Enterprise businesses_ (e.g. fully in-house solutions).

   These businesses have established pipelines that are known to deliver, but
   aren't necessarily efficient. However, enterprise businesses are more
   financially stable and can afford to commit to innovation.

   They may already have a framework in place to nurture and incubate
   experimental projects, allocating dedicated talent and resource to turn them
   a reality.

Every business must adapt to survive, and this can be either helped or hindered
by its investment in technology. For small businesses, the reliance on
technology isn't as great, and therefore neither is its impact. However, for
larger businesses, _flexibility_ (especially for mid-tier) and _scalability_
(especially for enterprise) are two key traits of the technology stack that are
needed to support any forward-looking organisation.
